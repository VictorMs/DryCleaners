Area rugs are an investment in your home, needing to be maintained and cared for to last many years. Proper area rug cleaning from a reputable Eagle Square Dry Cleaners helps your rugs and floor coverings look great for years longer than rugs which are not professionally cleaned. Area rugs bring warmth and comfort to your home.        </p>

It's a truth of home ownership in Vancouver. If you're going to buy area rugs as a solution for the way you live, you owe them the same time and attention as the other investments you've made in your home. So check out the following advice and make your investment in your area rugs lasts!	

<div class='subTitleClass'>Please Walk On Your Area Rugs</div>

It's important you understand that even though a handmade rug is a work of art, it's made to be used and walked on. Avoiding walking on your new area rug is like keeping a new car locked up in the garage, un-driven. With usage, as the top layers of pile (in most cases wool) break, the pile looks shinier and smoother, and with light exposure the colors look more harmonious.

Meanwhile, take the following few easy steps to make sure that your rug ages gracefully, naturally and beautifully.

<div class='subTitleClass'>Vacuum Area Rugs Regularly and Turn For Even Wear</div>

Rotate your area rug 180 degrees every few months, or every year, depending on traffic patterns. Rotation is necessary for two reasons. First, all parts of your area rug should be exposed to light equally so that the colors fade evenly. When colors are exposed to the sun evenly, they become harmonious and the rug ages nicely, but if different parts of the rug receive unequal amounts of sun exposure, over time, one side might look over faded and one side too bright. Second, is traffic. All parts of the area rug should be exposed to an equal amount of traffic so that the pile wears evenly.

<div class='subTitleClass'>Spot Cleaning Area Rugs</div>

A water spill should be dried immediately with a hairdryer set on a warm temperature. Try to dry both sides of your area rug if possible. In case of a soft drink or alcohol spill, apply salt or baking soda to the spot for a few minutes to absorb the color of the drink. Apply a small amount of vinegar to a pet stain to neutralize. Blot until dry. Then vacuum off the salt or baking soda.

After vacuuming the area rug, use a wet towel to gently wipe the stain in the direction of the nap (the direction the pile faces). Take it to the most convenient Martinizing Dry Cleaning or if you have pick-up and delivery laundry service, leave for your driver as soon as possible.

<div class='subTitleClass'>Always Get Your Area Rug Cleaned By Professional Dry Cleaning Experts</div>

Have your area rug cleaned by a Milwaukee dry cleaning professional at least every 2 to 3 years depending on the amount of traffic on the rug. It is important to clean your area rug professionally because as it is used, dust, dirt and broken fiber are ground into the rug. Professional area rug cleaning thoroughly removes the abrasive particles which degrade the structural integrity of the rug, and make it look dingy. Martinizing Dry Cleaners of Waukesha and Milwaukee can even restore fire and smoke damaged area rugs to their previous condition. Extending the life of your area rug with professional area rug cleaning is an investment which easily pays for itself with the extended years of use you will experience with your area rug.
